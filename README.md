# Audiocraft Infinity WebUI

Adds generation of songs with a length of over 30 seconds.

Adds the ability to continue songs.

Adds a seed option.

Disables (hopefully) the gradio analytics.

## Installation
Python 3.9 is recommended.

1. Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/1aienthusiast/audiocraft-infinity-webui.git`
2. Install pytorch:
`pip install 'torch>=2.0'`
3. Install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Clone the Meta audiocraft repo inside the `repositories` folder:
```
cd repositories
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft
cd ..
```
## Usage
```python webui.py```

## Updating
Run `git pull` inside the root folder to update the webui, and the same command inside `repositories/audiocraft` to update audiocraft.

## Models

Meta provides 4 pre-trained models. The pre trained models are:
- `small`: 300M model, text to music only - [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-small)
- `medium`: 1.5B model, text to music only - [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-medium)
- `melody`: 1.5B model, text to music and text+melody to music - [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-melody)
- `large`: 3.3B model, text to music only - [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-large)

**Needs a GPU!**

I recommend 12GB of VRAM for the large model.

## Colab

For google colab you need to replace `demo.launch()` with `demo.queue().launch(share=True)` in webui.py
